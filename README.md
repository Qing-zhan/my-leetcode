A collection of my leetcode solutions written in C++, preparing for the future.
You must do what you want to do, to become the man you want to be.

1. create a new repository on the command line
echo "# anotherRepo" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin git@github.com:Qing-zhan/anotherRepo.git
git push -u origin master

2. push an existing repository from the command line
git remote add origin git@github.com:Qing-zhan/anotherRepo.git
git push -u origin master

Note: In "git remote add origin git@github.com:Qing-zhan/anotherRepo.git", origin can be any name, which denotes the remote repo branch name. For example, the name can be specified as sasaki, then the remote branch on github is sasaki. The local branch (main branch) is master by default.
